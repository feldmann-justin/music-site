# music-site

As the description suggests, this is a project intended to showcase the skills in creating a RESTful API that I've attained from my internship with Spectrum, as well as just for my own enjoyment. Not too sure what it will turn out to be, possibly a music-related site/web app, hence the repo name.

To run, build a new Maven project, and execute the resulting .jar.
